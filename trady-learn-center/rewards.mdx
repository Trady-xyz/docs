Your tier depends on any of the following (meeting **one** requirement is enough to level up):

- 30-day spot trading volume
- Referral trading volume (spot)

The higher your tier, the higher your cashback rate:

**Cashback Range:** **5% → 50%**

**Cashback Formula:**

cashback = (trading volume \*  fee\_) \_\* cashback rate

net fee = fee - cashback

### Referral System

Earn rewards from **three levels** of your referral network — direct, indirect, and extended.\
Your referral rewards scale with your tier:

**Rates Range:**

- L1 (Direct): **5% → 50%**
- L2 (Indirect): **1% → 5.5%**
- L3 (Extended): **0.25% → 2.5%**
- Referral bonus: Join via referral and get +35% cashback during your first 30 days

### Negative Fees

In this campaign, trading fees are replaced with a reward for every executed order. Credits are applied automatically and can be viewed in the user’s account history.
