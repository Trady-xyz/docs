## Buy & Trade

To start trading or buying an asset, the user should go to the **Trade** page and select the desired asset from the dropdown menu. Once the asset is chosen, the purchase form allows the user to complete the transaction step by step:

1. **Select Payment Token** – Choose from the available options in the dropdown menu.
2. **Enter Amount** – Input the amount manually in the chosen token or use the preset buttons for quick selection.
3. **Review Transaction Details** – The platform will display: The amount of the asset to be received; Gas fees; Final total amount.

If the account balance is insufficient, the user can click **Deposit** to add funds. Once enough funds are available, the transaction can be confirmed and completed immediately.

Selling an asset works similarly. The user selects the asset to sell, specifies the quantity, chooses a payment method, and confirms the transaction. The system will then display the total amount the user will receive after fees.

This process ensures that buying, selling, and trading assets is smooth, transparent, and easy to follow.
