Trady’s cross-chain architecture enables seamless, intent-driven transactions across multiple blockchains. It is built around a modular, secure, and high-performance system where each component plays a specific role in routing, verifying, and executing user operations.

It consists of key components working together: 

- Trady Backend: The central service that receives requests, determines optimal routing, and coordinates with solvers and bundlers across different chains. 
- Solver Network: Liquidity providers and routing aggregators that execute transactions on destination chains and provide optimal execution paths.

### Aggregated Assets

Trady aggregates assets between chains into a unified balance, simplifying cross-chain management and trading.

Aggregated assets are Trady’s unified token representation that combines the same token across multiple blockchain networks into a single asset, instead of tracking it separately on Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum, you simply work with one asset representing all your holdings across supported chains.

You can think of aggregated assets as your **“universal wallet view”** – one asset that automatically manages all your cross-chain token holdings behind the scenes.

### Aggregated USD (USDT + USDC)

Trady unifies your stable holdings into one single USD balance available to spend in a single transaction. Even if you have USDT and USDC fractions across 10 different networks, the combined balance remains fully available to use in one seamless operation.

### Gas-Abstraction

With Trady, you forget not only about bridges, but about gas and gas tokens too.

Trady uses a paymaster service that sponsors on-chain gas fees on behalf of users, enabling gasless transactions and significantly improving the overall experience.

### Transaction Lifecycle

A Trady transaction moves through four coordinated phases. Each phase ensures optimal routing, user safety, and efficient settlement across chains.

#### 1. Initial Request Phase

The process begins when the user submits an intent, for example: **“Swap ETH (from any chain) for SOL on Solana.”**

Trady then:

- Aggregates available balances across different chains.
- Checks which funds are eligible for spending without altering the user flow.
- Processes the request and determines the best multi-chain route.

Our system automatically detects how much liquidity the user has on each chain, enabling seamless multi-chain spending within a single intent.

#### 2. Quote Phase

Next, the solver system generates a complete quote, which includes:

- Pricing
- Estimated gas costs
- Swap fees

The user:

1. Receives the quote
2. Reviews the execution details
3. Signs the operation using their **session key**
4. Sends the signed operation back to Trady for processing

#### 3. RL Phase

Once Trady receives the signed operation, it is forwarded to our **Risk & Logic (RL) Service**.

The RL Service:

- Verifies that the request is valid
- Evaluates the security posture of the operation
- Issues a **security attestation**

Depending on the security assessment, the transaction continues along an appropriate execution path.

#### 4. Execution Phase

Trady submits both the operation and the corresponding security guarantees to the solver.

From here, execution can follow **one of three paths**, depending on:

- The assets involved
- The security attestation
- The optimal route determined by the solver
