# Security Settings

Your profile becomes your personal control hub for account and security management. Use these features to protect your account and assets.

## Security features

Trady provides comprehensive security options to keep your account safe:

### Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification method when logging in.

    Use an authenticator app or SMS verification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify setup">

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Anti-phishing code

Set a unique code that appears in all official Trady emails to help you identify legitimate communications.

Choose a memorable code that you'll recognize instantly in emails from Trady.
</Tip>

### Email verification

Verify your email address to enable account recovery and receive important notifications.

### Passkeys

Use passkeys for passwordless authentication with biometric verification or security keys.

<Info>
Passkeys provide stronger security than traditional passwords and are resistant to phishing attacks.

### Withdrawal limits

Set custom withdrawal limits to protect your funds:

- **Daily limits**: Maximum amount you can withdraw per day
